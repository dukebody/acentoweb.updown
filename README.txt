Introduction
============
This package provides a new contentratings' rating category with
a binary up/down vocabulary.

To enable it:

1. Install the acentoweb.updown package in your Plone site. This will
install plone.contentratings too.

2. Go to the Ratings control panel (from Site Setup) and assign the
UpDown category to the content-types you want to enable this feature
at.


TODO
=====
- Show number of ups/downs instead of the average.
- Improve the presentation.
